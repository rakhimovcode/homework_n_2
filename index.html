        </center>
        <p style="margin: 50px auto; max-width: 900px; padding: 10px; height: 450px;" >Hi, I’m <strong>Abrorbek</strong>, born in 2006 in Uzbekistan. From a young age, I’ve always been curious about the world and eager to learn new things. Whether it’s diving into a book, solving a problem, or picking up a new skill, I’ve found joy in constantly challenging myself to grow.
        
        I’m fluent in English and have recently started learning German, with big dreams of pursuing my master’s degree in Germany. I’ve set ambitious goals for myself, and I believe in the power of consistent effort to achieve them.
        
        Technology and programming have captured my interest in recent years. I’m currently learning Python and exploring its endless possibilities. This journey into coding has not only expanded my skill set but also strengthened my passion for creating and problem-solving. Beyond tech, I enjoy puzzles, chess, and logical games. I admire players like Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Hikaru Nakamura and often follow their games for inspiration.
        
        In my downtime, I love watching movies, with "The Godfather" being my all-time favorite. Its deep lessons about life, loyalty, and decision-making resonate with me profoundly.
        
        I like to think of myself as someone who balances ambition with kindness. My friends often describe me as reliable, lighthearted, and always ready to share a laugh. But deep down, I’m someone who takes life seriously, striving to make the most of my time and leave a mark in everything I do.
        
        I believe in dreaming big, working hard, and staying focused. Every step I take is a move toward the future I envision, and I’m excited about the journey ahead.
